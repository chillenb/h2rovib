# Accurate ab-initio calculation of the ideal-gas heat capacity of H<sub>2</sub>

## How to run the code
The electronic structure calculation is in [this notebook](https://github.com/chillenb/h2rovib/blob/main/h2curve.ipynb). You will need [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/) to run it.

The rest of the calculations are in [this notebook](https://github.com/chillenb/h2rovib/blob/main/vib.ipynb). NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib are dependencies.
